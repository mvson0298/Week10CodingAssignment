# Week10CodingAssignment
In these exercises, you will expand the menu application to list all projects (name and ID). Then, you will write code to select a project to edit. This will involve returning a selected project along with all project details. This will further our pursuit of implementing CRUD operations on database tables.

In these exercises, you will:

·       Hone your SQL query skills by writing SQL statements to fetch a List of Project records.

·       Learn how to perform multiple queries in a single transaction.

·       Write an inner join to fetch category rows related to a project row.

·       Use an Optional to either return a project record or to throw a custom Exception.

·       Practice writing Lambda expressions both to list the projects and to throw a custom Exception from an Optional.
